# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## The README contains an explanation of:
The pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.
  The benefits of the chosen parameter sampler.
  The benefits of the chosen early stopping policy.

	
## The README contains:
One or more sentences describing the model and parameters generated by AutoML.
Two or more sentences comparing the two models and their performance.

## 	The README contains two or more sentences explaining potential improvements for a future experiment and why these improvements might improve the model.
